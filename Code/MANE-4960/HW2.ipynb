    "Quantum photonics has the ability to be scaled up. In a recent paper named \"Scalable integrated single-photon source\", scalable single photon source qubits are discussed. The way scalability and coherence are meausred is with a boson sampler, and the conclusion of the paper is that it's possible to create a scalable single photon system. \n",

    "Photonic qubits can be initialized to a fiducial state. A paper named \"Comparison Between Different Qubit Designs for Quantum\n",
    "Computing \" includes information regarding the initialization procedure for several qubit technologies, and for photonic qubits, it involves controlling the polariziation of the photon source. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Long coherence times\n",
    "A paper published in Nature named \"Decoherence-protected memory for a single-photon qubit\" demonstrated that memory could be kept in photonics for upwards of 100ms, which is far more than the microsecond coherence times of superconducting qubits.\n",

    "#### Universal set of quantum gates\n",
    "A universal set of quantum gates could be applied to a photonic system. A paper called \"Integrated photonic quantum gates for polarization qubits\" demonstrates the uses of a CNOT gate on a photonic system via manipulation of the polarization of the photon source. \n",

    "#### Ability to measure qubit states\n",
    "In the same paper, a set of observables can be measured in a photonic system by receiving the wavepacket of the photons and plotting it out, much like a superconducting qubit system. "

    "# The VC Proposal\n",
    "Photonics qubits is by far, the best qubit modality for building scalable quantum computing systems. To list all the reasons is to be verbose, but to name a few, its relatively low operating costs, great scalability, long coherence times, and relation to quantum communication all contribute to it being the premier qubit modality in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equipment necessary for creating a photonics quantum system is quite low. All that's required is a source of polarized photon beam, lensing mirrors, measuring equipment, and some sort of physical representation for quantum gates. There is no need for complicated dilution refrigerators like superconducting qubits or expensive Paul traps like trapped ion qubits. Photonic qubits also offer great scalability. Though the biggest quantum system is built with superconducting qubits (IBM's Condor, sporting 1,121 qubits), photonic systems scale up without issue using photonic chips. Since quantum photonics is manipulated with polarization and lensing, there is no fear that photonic systems would lose coherence as it scales up, unlike superconducting qubits. Photonic qubits also have much longer coherence times when compared to other qubit modalities. Superconducting qubits for example, have coherence times along microseconds, whereas photonics have conherence times in the 100s of milliseconds. This property of long coherent times also lend to photonic systems being incredibly error resistant, which reduces the need for intense error correction/suppression regimes like superconducting qubits or trapped ion systems. Finally, photonic qubits are used in quantum communication as well, and research into photonic qubits would lead to parallel advancement with quantum communication, essentially killing two birds with one stone. \n",
    "\n",
    "With all that being said, it's clear the investing into photonic research is not only funding a superior qubit modality, but also allowing for a diverse set of quantum hardware to be developed. "
