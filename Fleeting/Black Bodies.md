A black body is an ideal physical system in thermal equilibrium. Put another way, it absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and reflects/transmits none in return. Due to the fact that it doesn't emit any electromagnetic radiation, it should theoretically be black. 

## Black Body Radiation Spectrum
There are three kinds of spectrums that are typically found experimentally. 
#### The Continuous Spectrum
The continuous spectrum comes from some sort of hot and dense body, like the sun. It encapsulates all radiation from the visible frequencies.
 
#### The Absorption Spectrum
The absorption spectrum comes from light traveling through some absorbing medium, like a cold gas. This spectrum is represented by all the continuous black lines.

#### The Emission Spectrum
The emission spectrum is comes from rarefied hot gases. Unlike the two other spectrums, this spectrum is comprised discrete frequencies that correspond to photons emitted by excited gas atoms at specific frequencies

## History
Black bodies are first theorized by Gustav Kirchoff (Kirchoff's junction rule person) in 1859. The relation between temperature and total energy radiated per surface area is proven experimentally by the Stefan and Ludwig Boltzmann law in 1884. After that, the relation between peak wavelength and temperature is proven experimentally by Wilhelm Wien in 1893 with Wien's displacement law.  It was discovered that the black body radiation spectrum in fact did not rely on the body radiation and instead on temperature and wavelength. This helped prove that thermal radiation is a matter of electromagnetic radiation.
