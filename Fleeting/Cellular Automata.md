Cellular automata is just a a collection of cells next to other cells. They update their states based on their neighbors' states. This view of individual cells can apply to fluid simulation. The Lattice Boltzmann method is used in fluid simulations and the updating of the individual particles is dictated by classical physics. Quantum solutions give varyingly levels of speedups and depend on the problem.
