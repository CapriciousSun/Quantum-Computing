Classical information is usually represented by the variable X and a set Σ. X is assumed to be in a finite number of classical states at every moment. So if X were a bit, it would be represented as $$Σ = \{0, 1\}$$There may be uncertainties about the classical state of a system where some probability is associated with the system. The probabilistic state of X is $$PR(X = 0)  = \frac{3}{4}\ and\ PR(X=1) = \frac{1}{4}$$
It can also be represented as a column vector, or a probability vector, since the numbers add up to 1 no matter what. $$\large\begin{pmatrix}\frac{3}{4}\\\frac{1}{4}\end{pmatrix}$$
