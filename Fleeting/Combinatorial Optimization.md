Combinatorial optimization 

## Example: Portfolio Optimization
Portfolio optimization has two key weights to think about. Continuous weight, which has the formula $$\min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^n}w^TΣw - qμ^Tw;\ Σw_{i} = 1$$and binary weight, which has the formula $$\min_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n}x^TΣx - qμ^Tw;\ Σx_{i} = B$$
Typically, a mixed formulation involves continuous weights with binary weights being introduced with constraints.
