Continuing on from [[Dirac Notation Part 1]], whereas the ket represents a column vector, a bra represents a row vector. In a set $Î£ = {0, 1}$
$$\bra{0} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ and \ \ \ \bra{1} = \begin{pmatrix}0 &1\end{pmatrix}$$
When a bra and a ket get multiplied, the system of equation looks like $$\braket{a|b} = \bra{a}\ket{b} = \begin{cases}
1\ \ \ a = b\\
0\ \ \ a \neq b
\end{cases}$$as in when the bra and ket aren't equal and don't like up, the answer is equal to 0, or else they're equal and the answer is 1. Multiplying a column vector by a row vector ends up with a matrix.
