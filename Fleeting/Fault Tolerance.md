There are a few ways to get to better qubits. First, is to improve [[Physical Qubits]] quality and controls. This includes increasing coherence times and improving hardware and control protocols. Second, is to develop better ways to correct [[Errors & Decoherence]] using extra qubits, this is analogous to the test bits that classical computers have. Third, is to develop ways to convert between qubits. 

## In Superconductors
Most superconducting qubits use the transmon architecture, which involves a Josephson junction coupled to a capacitor to smooth out sensitivity. A Josephson junction is two superconductors separated by an insulator. Improving a superconductor in the past involved using better geometry and placement, using better materials, and improving manufacturing precision and consistency. 

## In Controllers
Lasers and RF generators are what used to control qubits typically, and they are prone to phase noise. Control pulses can be optimized so that paths that are faster or more error-resistant can be chosen. Reinforcement learning is coupled with controllers optimization as well.
