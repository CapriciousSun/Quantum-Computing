Searching through an unsorted list is O(N) regularly. Grover's search reduces this to O($\sqrt{ N }$), using quantum entanglement to amplify the probability amplitude of the target item. It iterates multiple times until the probability is peaked around the correct item. It is important to note that any classical algorithm can be converted to a Grover search algorithm. It can take a lot of work, but it ignores constant factors and guarantees a quadratic speedup.
