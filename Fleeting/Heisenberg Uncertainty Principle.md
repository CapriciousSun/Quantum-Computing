The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is derived from the single slit diffraction experiment. The maximum angle θ that light spreads out from the slit is calculated as $$sin(θ) = \frac{λ}{a}$$
where λ is the wavelength of the photon and a is the width of the slit. Also, $$sin(θ) = \frac{Δp}{p}$$ or change in momentum over the overall momentum. With the relation $$\frac{λ}{a} = \frac{Δp}{p}$$ established, that must mean $$λp = Δpa$$
$$λp = λ\frac{h}{λ}=h$$
Since a is the slit width, it also represents the range of positional values that the photons could occupy, so the whole equation can be rewritten as $$ΔpΔx = h$$
or when the intensity pattern is taken into account for, $$ΔpΔx \geqslant \frac{h}{2}$$
