There are several physical representations of qubits that have garnered the most attention

#### Trapped Ions
- individual ions of ytterbium and boron trapped by electrostatic fields
- these ions are then read by lasers
- has all-to-all connection, where one qubit can to another without limitations
- It can scale up to 100 qubit per chip with great coherence time (somewhere around ms to seconds) and capable of error correction
- one of the first modalities of qubits tested

#### Neutral Atoms
- typically rubidium or [] that's been cooled to a very low temperature
- magnetic fields and lasers trap atoms in a grid
- has near neighbor connection
- error correction has been demonstrated before

#### Photons
- uses photons as qubits
- can be incredibly dense, with millions of physical qubits
- highly noise resistance, but it's hard to manipulate due to the nature of photons
- used frequently in networking
#### Crystal Defects
- uses vacancies inside of crystals to create artificial atoms and spin
	- typically diamonds or silicon carbide
- doesn't require near zero kelvin temperatures in order to work, but works better with lower temperature due to resolution
- current interest include networking

#### Superconducting Circuits
- uses a Josephson junction connected to a capacitor or inductor
- cooled to around 10 mK of temperature and manipulated with microwaves
- moderate coherence times and fast gate times
- various connectivity and is the current leading paradigm for computing

Every single method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's not clear which will win just yet. 
- superconductors are fast, but the maintenance required on them is expensive
- ions are stable, but are slow and requires networking for scaling
- atoms are stable and can scale, but are slow as well
- photons are stable, but are hard to manipulate
