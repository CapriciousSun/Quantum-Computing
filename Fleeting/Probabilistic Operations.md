Probabilistic operations are classical operations that may introduce randomness to a system. They are typically represented by stochastic matrices, matrices where all entries are represented by non-negative real numbers and all the entries in a column sum to 1. Essentially, every column forms a probability vector. A stochastic matrix for the probabilistic operation "If classical state is 0, then do nothing, if classical state is 1, then flip the bit with probability 1/2" would look like $$\begin{pmatrix}1\ \ \ \frac{1}{2}\\0\ \ \ \frac{1}{2}\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1\ \ \ 1\\0\ \ \ 0\end{pmatrix} \ + \ \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1 \ \ \ 0\\0\ \ \ 1\end{pmatrix}$$
