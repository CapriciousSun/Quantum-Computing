In quantum physics, quantum objects have properties that are discrete, meaning they occupy only certain values and not others. This typically refers to the transitions between energy levels that particles can occupy, illustrated by the energy valley. The quantization of energy is backbone underpinning all the concepts in quantum physics, and is therefore incredibly important.

## Black Body Radiation
The quantization of energy is first conceived of trying to predict the spectrum curve of [[Black Bodies|black bodies]]. Wien's approximation law didn't work for large wavelength, whereas Rayleigh-Jean's formula didn't work for small wavelength. Only when Max Planck set $\text{E = nhv}$, where n is a positive integer, did the wavelength prediction start to line up, despite there being no apparent reason why.

## The Photoelectric Effect
Albert Einstein's photoelectric effect experiments showed that light and electrons didn't interact based on the intensity of the photons, but rather the frequency. It also showed that the energy of an electromagnetic field is not in the form of a wavefront, but rather a wave packet with a single direction. 

## Quantum Numbers
[[Quantum Numbers|Quantum numbers]] refer to the discrete number of entities that a system could have. Put simply, in terms of energy, these map out discontinuous energy transitions between different energy levels.
