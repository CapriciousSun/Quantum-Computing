It's been shown that there can be a universal set of gates, much like the NAND gate for Turing completeness. Two qubit gate operations can create entanglement that cannot be decomposed into single qubit gate operations. $$U(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = \begin{pmatrix}
\cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) & -e^{-i\lambda}\sin\left( \frac{\theta}{2}  \\
\right) \\
e^{i\phi}\sin\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) & e^{i}
\end{pmatrix}$$

A Pauli gate is a 2^n x 2^n matrix, which is called an operator as well. 

The tensor product is what's used to assemble individual gates. These entangle gates cannot be decomposed.
