A quantum harmonic oscillator is a quantum analog of the classical harmonic oscillator. It is an important concept used to model wavefunction and energy of a particle.

## Formalism
The way to calculated a quantum harmonic oscillator is quite similar to a classical harmonic oscillator.
```ad-formula
#### General Form of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
Knowing the potential energy a quantum harmonic oscillator is the first step to solving the total energy of the system.
#### $$V(x) = \frac{1}{2}mω^{2}x^{2}$$
This can be plugged into the [[Schrodinger's Equation|Schrodinger equation]].
#### $$-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \frac{\partial^{2} ψ}{\partial x^{2}} + \frac{1}{2}mω^{2}x^{2}ψ = Eψ$$
Move around the the variables to isolate the double derivative.
#### $$\frac{\partial^{2} ψ}{\partial x^{2}} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^{2}} \left(\frac{1}{2}mω^{2}x^{2} - E \right)ψ $$
The energy variable can be removed for assuming $x$ to be sufficiently big.
#### $$\frac{\partial^{2} ψ}{\partial x^{2}} \approx \frac{mω^{2}x^{2}}{\hbar^{2}}ψ $$
