Quantum information can be represented in one of two ways. The simplified description and the general description.
The simplified description has states being represented with vectors and operations being represented with unitary matrices. This description is easy, but doesn't account for noise.
The general description has states being represented with density matrices. Measurements and operations can include noise. It can also include classical information as a special case.
