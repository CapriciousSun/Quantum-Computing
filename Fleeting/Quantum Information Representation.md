Quantum information can be represented in one of two ways. The simplified description and the general description.
The simplified description has states being represented with column vectors and operations being represented with unitary matrices. This description is easy, but doesn't account for noise.
The general description has states being represented with density matrices. Measurements and operations can include noise. It can also include classical information as a special case.
The entries of a column vector for quantum information are all complex numbers  where the absolute value squared of all entries is equal to 1. 
The Euclidean norm for vectors with complex number entries is written like $$v = \begin{pmatrix}α_1\\\vdots\\a_n\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ \ ||v|| = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{n}|α_k|^2}$$Another way of putting this is that quantum state vectors are merely unit vectors with respect to the Euclidean norm.
