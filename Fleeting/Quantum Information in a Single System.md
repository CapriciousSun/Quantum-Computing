Quantum information can be stored as a single system, as multiple different systems like in quantum algorithms with multiple qubits, or protocols that process quantum information and transmit it between qubits

A single system is the most simple and its description leads naturally to the description of multiple systems. It is defined by a column vector known as the Euclidean norm.

The Euclidean norm
$${v} = \begin{pmatrix}α_{1} \\ \vdots \\ α_{n}\end{pmatrix} \implies ||{v}|| = \sqrt{\sum_{{k} = 1}^{{n}}}{|a_{k}|^{2}}$$
```
