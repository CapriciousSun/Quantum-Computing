Quantum machine learning can be separated by the data type and algorithm type, both having classical and quantum. 

## Classical Machine Learning
Classical machine learning is an extremely computationally intensive task since it requires a great amount of data, inputs, and calculations. What it functionally does is simulate what neurons do, and could model any mathematical function given enough parameters.

## Quantum Machine Learning
Similar to classical machine learning, it uses a parameterized quantum circuit an an optimization loop to find the best possible parameters. The training is similar to to a VQE, and trained circuits are used to make predictions about a dataset to create new data elements.
