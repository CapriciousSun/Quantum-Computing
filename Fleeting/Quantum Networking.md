Coherent quantum information can be sent between two quantum devices, usually using optical photons. 

## Teleportation
The main method for sending quantum information is what's called teleportation. Quantum information cannot be copied, only moved, and that's called the "No-Cloning Theorem". Qubits sent requires two classical bits to be sent to define the measurement basis. The current records for teleportation is 143km through air, 102km through fiber optics, and 21m through solids. In order to increase the distance, quantum repeaters that encode quantum memory, re-entangles and re-transmitts quantum memory. Bob requires Alice's classical results to apply the right gates and recover the qubit. 

## Quantum Key Distribution
Quantum key distribution (QKD) is for sending cryptographic keys over a network. Entanglement is not required, only superposition is. A current existing protocol is called BB84. It's perfectly secure ***in principal***, but actual security is debated. If there was an eavesdropper is in the middle, the message sent would be distorted and both sides would know. Both the NSA and the NIST oppose QKD. There are some issues raised. 
#### Issues
- There is no authentication of users
- It's vulnerable to denial of service attacks
- The supply chain security is uncertain
- The physical validation side is incomplete
- There are physical hardware security issues
