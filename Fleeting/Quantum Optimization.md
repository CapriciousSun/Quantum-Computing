There are several applications that quantum computing could offer an advantage to. This includes [[RSA Decryption]], [[Grover's Algorithm]], and. other uses of quantum problem solving. 

Fields of logistics and operations research, as well as industrial engineering, have factorial level problems as their worst case. Quantum computing does not guarantee an exponential speedup, but it can help provide problem-specific advantages. There are some uses today, like superconducting quantum annealers and the QAOA algorithm. 

## Matrix Solving
Matrix solving is what most engineering calculations are on. Systems of partial differential equations are important to engineering as well. For example, the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm solves sparse matrices in O(log N) time. However, it's O(N) to just solve the problem regularly, and the output wouldn't be a solution field, only an expectation value, so consideration needs to be made regarding using quantum computing here.
