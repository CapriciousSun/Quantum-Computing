Quantum superposition refers to the fact that quantum states can only exist in discrete states, with certain possibilities assigned to each of the states. Before being observed, those states exist in possibilities with no way of concretely knowing what state they are in unless observed. The [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] states that $$ΔpΔx \geqslant \frac{h}{2}$$
which means that the more you know about the velocity of an object, the less you would know about it's position in space time, and vice versa. The total amount you could know about an object is given $h$, or Planck's constant. 
Then there's Schrodinger's equation$$\frac{h^2}{2m}\nabla^2Ψ\ + \ VΨ\ = \ ih\frac{dΨ}{dt}$$which contextualizes quantum particles as definitive waves. It should be noted that particles can technically be visualized in its wave form, per this research paper [[In-situ Imaging of a Single-Atom Wave Packet in Continuous Space.pdf]]. However, the particles will collapse, albeit, changing positions due to aforementioned HUP.
