The standard basis states of qubits is $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. There are also plus and minus states, which are commonly seen and written as $$\ket{+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}\ \ \ and\ \ \ \ket{-} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{0} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1}$$
The basis states of qubits are $$|0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0
\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ \ |1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
1
\end{pmatrix}$$
The Bell state is developed by John S. Bell in 1964 and it demonstrates superposition and entanglement, whilst ruling out the hidden variable theory. This is the building block of quantum. ![[Pasted image 20240917162154.png]]
There are four basic Bell states $$|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$$
$$|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(|00\rangle - |11\rangle)$$
$$|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(|01\rangle + |10\rangle)$$
$$|\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(|01\rangle - |10\rangle)$$
The Hadamard gate places $q_0$ into superposition and the node connecting $q_0$ and $q_1$ entangles both qubits.
