The RSA system is secure due to the exponential difficulty of factoring prime numbers. This is hard for a classical computer as it would take too much time to exploit. Factoring has a periodic structure to it that's easy for quantum computers to solve, and Shor's Algorithm exploits exactly that. [[Logical Qubits]] are what's needed for Shor's Algorithm to work efficiently.
