Stabilizer codes are what's used to help correct for errors in qubit operators and create logical qubits.

## The Shor Codes
Peter Shor developed 5 and 9 qubit error correcting codes that can help create basic [[Logical Qubits]]. These are the minimum size that's needed for error correction. Ancilla qubits themselves have error, so more ancilla qubits are needed. 

## Surface Codes
Surface codes use a 2D lattice of qubits to create logical qubits. It's a good fit for superconductors since they use a lattice architecture. They can tolerate high single-qubit errors, but have a very high overhead, using 100s to 1000s of physical qubits for a single logical qubit.
