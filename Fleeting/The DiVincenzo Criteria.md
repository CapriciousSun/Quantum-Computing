There are several requirements for a proper quantum system
- must have two or more well characterized quantum states
- must be reliabily initialized into a known state
- can be controlled through a set of universal operations (current being qubit gate operations)
- can be controlled through a controllable readout process
- have long (sorta) coherence times
For networking the requirements are 
- have the ability to convert stationary and flying qubits
	- flying qubits are typically streams of photons
- have the ability to transmit flying qubits between locations
