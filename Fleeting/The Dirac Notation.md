The Dirac Notation is used in describing vectors, and it is central to the way quantum information is described. In the notation, Σ can be any ordered classical state set. The ordering is important. Many classical states have a standard ordering, and for those that don't, one can be chosen. 
$|a\rangle$ is denoted as the column vector with a 1 in an entry corresponding to $a \in Σ$, with 0 for every other entry. 
As an example, if Σ = {0, 1}, then $$|0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ and\ \ \ |1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix}$$
An example of a regularly unordered set would be if Σ = {♣,♦,♥,♠}, then
$$|♣\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ \ |♦\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ \ |♥\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}\ \ \ \ |♠\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}$$
Classical states mean set means that the sets are always non-empty and finite, and they are called standard basis vectors, something that any vector can be expressed by, for example $$\begin{pmatrix}\frac{3}{4}\\\frac{1}{4}\end{pmatrix} = \frac{3}{4}|0\rangle\ +\ \frac{1}{4}|1\rangle$$
