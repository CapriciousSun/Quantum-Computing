Certain quantum particles form "braids" in space time, with some including Majorana Fermions and Nonabelian Anyons, where once you apply a gate, the system would get stuck and the only way to unstuck the system is to apply the inverse gate. They are difficult to "untangle", and so far, no one has successfully made a topological qubit. If someone does manage to successfully make a topological quantum qubit, they would win the technology race since error correction on a topological quantum qubit is far more straightforward than other qubit modalities.
