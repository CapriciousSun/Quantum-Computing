The set of operations that can be done on a quantum state is different than that of a classical state. Those operations are represented by unitary matrices.

Unitary Matrices
A unitary matrix is a square matrix $\mathbb{Ï…}$ that satisfies the condition $$\mathcal{U}^{\dagger}\mathcal{U} = \mathbb{1} = \mathcal{UU}^{\dagger}$$
where dagger represents the conjugate transpose from [[Dirac Notation|Dirac notation]] and $\mathbb{1}$ represents the identity matrix
```
Another way to characterize a unitary matrix is showing that Euclidean norm never changes even when matrices are multiplied to it. Mathematically, it looks like $$||Uv|| = ||v||$$If $v$ is a quantum state vector, then $Uv$ is a quantum state vector too.
